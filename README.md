# LiverTumorSeg

Liver Tumor segmentation and classfication using CT scans.This project utilizes NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format CT scans, represented as NIfTI images (.nii files). NIfTI is commonly used in medical imaging due to its flexibility in storing neuroimaging data. In our project, NIfTI images serve as the primary input data. It preprocesses NIfTI images, applies bilateral filtering for noise reduction, and utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for feature extraction and classification. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of tumor detection in medical imagery, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning. The project showcases the integration of advanced image processing techniques and state-of-the-art deep learning models for medical image analysis, contributing to advancements in healthcare technology.
